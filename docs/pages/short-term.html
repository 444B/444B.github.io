    <h1>Short-term Vision</h1>
    <p> The short term vision is to develop some skills for web dev as I progress through the my dApp course material
        <br>
        The full application of these skills will be in a website for a charity stake pools called AfricaPools.io <br>
        The Cardano stake pool will also need to be developed and audited. The process of an audit will need to be
        stored in order to fuel the 2nd Stage <br>
        The stake pool itself will have 3 objectives <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a node in South Africa that will boost Cardano TX's and decentralization</li>
        <li>Use an ISPO model to fund itself and future stake pool strategies, as described in <a
                href="C:\Users\User\Desktop\WebDev\site\roadmap.html">the Roadmap</a></li>
        <li>Use stake rewards to fuel local adoption of Cardano and donate to charity projects</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
