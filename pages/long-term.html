    <h1>Long-term Vision</h1>
    <p>The long term vison has a few components <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Branch Growth</h2>
    <p>
        This phase will roll out upon or alongside the plans set out in Phase 2 (Medium Term vision) <br>
        The idea is to deploy similar models to various countries in the African continent. There is no limitation to
        this scope, any other countries are welcome to join in <br>
    </p>

    <h2>DeGov</h2>
    <p>The DeGov phase is a method of striving for Decentralzed Governance, part of the Voltaire phase of the Cardano
        roadmap <br>
        This is set to be the most difficult part on the part of IOHK and we will follow the updates eagerly <br>
        From my inital thoughts, there will need to be a digital constitution that is composed by the community and pins
        values of the Cardano vision<br>
        This phase could happen in a few ways: a constitutional alteration inside an existing country or alongside
        it<br>
        This is very much in the distant future and Africapools hopes to set down the essential groundwork in Africa in
        order for Voltaire to have fertile soil to grow in <br>
