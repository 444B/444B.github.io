    <h1>Medium-term Vision</h1>
    <p> once a viable financial model has been achieved as described in <a
            href="/pages/short-term.html">Stage 1</a><br>
        a model would need to be developed for the deployment of similar systems into other African Countries (branch
        stake pools) <br>
        The development of sibling stake pools would require for independant SPOs to be:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Found</li>
        <li>Trained</li>
        <li>Certified</li>
        <li>Audited regularly</li><br>
    </ul> These branch stake pools will operate independantly but in a similar model to the original, with a commitment
    to: <ol>
        <li>Decentralization</li>
        <li>Stability and Security</li>
        <li>Local adoption and charity</li>
    </ol>
    During the inital setup + auditing process, the stake rewards of branch Stake pools for an initially determined
    period will go into the development of AfricaPools as an organization. <br>
    These stake rewards will begin to revert back to the branch stake pool upon passing an Audit and then incrementally
    as POC charity initiatives are demonstrated. <br>
    <!-- This fundign + staking process needs refinement, which will take place in the future -->
    </p>
