    <h1>Short-term Vision</h1>
    <p> The short term vision is to develop some skills for web dev as I progress through the my dApp course material
        <br>
        The full application of these skills will be in a website for a charity stake pools called AfricaPools.io <br>
        The Cardano stake pool will also need to be developed and audited. The process of an audit will need to be
        stored in order to fuel the 2nd Stage <br>
        The stake pool itself will have 3 objectives <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a node in South Africa that will boost Cardano TX's and decentralization</li>
        <li>Use an ISPO model to fund itself and future stake pool strategies, as described in <a
                href="/pages/roadmap.html">the Roadmap</a></li>
        <li>Use stake rewards to fuel local adoption of Cardano and donate to charity projects</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Random thoughts</h3>
    <p>
The point of Africapools is to provide auditing, certification and advice to SPO's while adhering to the concept of decentralization <br>
We want to launch Stake pool networks in Africa without compromising on the principle of Decentralization. Each Stake pool that works with AfricaPools will be <br>
<ul>
    <li>Mature and eventually become Independant from AfricaPools in operation</li>
    <li>Have complete control of the Stake pool with no technical backdoors</li>
    <li>Adhere to the Proposed deployment plan and become financially self sustaining</li>
    <li>Promote local adoption of Cardano via local community donations from srake pool rewards</li>
    <li>adopt a strategy for community involvement and aim to operate with as little centralized power as necessary</li>
    <li>Perform operations in a secure manner, in a physical envrionment that does not compromise on the fundamentals of Cardano</li>
</ul>
There is an idea to incorporate monitoring (prometheus) and perhaps an EDR component to the children stake pools but this is just an idea currently and will need to have the pros and cons considered.
