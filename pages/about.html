    <H1>About Me</H1>
    <p>My name is 444B and I want to learn alot of things. <br>
        The sea of computers and their uses is truly endless <br>
        I want to become a blockchain developer<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain"> Link</a></sup>
        and I have alot to learn <br>
        To be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom
        of others</p>

    <h2>This page</h2>
    <p>
        This page is meant to be a place to practise and express myself <br>
    </p>
    <p>The thing that I want to undertake is truly huge. I have had to reign in the scope into different lengths <br>
        I am focusing on studying the 10 year vision material and not necessarily the steps directly in front of me <br>
        I do this because I believe that you should understand your destination and goal clearly before setting out for
        it <br>
        Once you set out, you can alter your course but you cant undo the work along the way <br>
        It is very important to think and consider very well before setting out on your way <br>

    <h2>Goals and Steps</h2>
    <p>It is pretty important to set concrete goals and break it up into smaller stepssteps </p>
